For the Milestone 5 

Sign-Up Page with Form Validation
Overview
This project involves creating a Sign-Up Page where users can enter their details to create an account. The page includes fields for:

Name
Email
Password
The form will be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a clean design and smooth experience.

Form Validation
To ensure valid user input, we implement form validation, which checks:

The email format is correct.
The password meets security criteria (e.g., minimum length).
No required fields are left empty.
Milestone 5 Goals
In this milestone, we will:
✅ Build the Sign-Up Page using HTML & CSS.
