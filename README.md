In this milestone, we’ll build an API endpoint to fetch all product data from the database and display it dynamically on the frontend using a reusable product card component.

Why This Milestone is Important

Learn to Send and Receive Data: Understand how to connect the frontend and backend to retrieve data.

Dynamic Rendering: Display data dynamically by passing it to components, improving scalability and efficiency.


Reusable Components: Use a single component to display multiple products without writing repetitive code.

How it works :

Backend: The GET endpoint fetches all products from the MongoDB database.

Frontend: The fetchProducts function calls the API to get the product data.
=======
Product Management System

This project focuses on building a simple product management feature using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 

You’ll create a Product Schema, set up an API endpoint to save product data, and learn how to ensure data integrity through validation.

Why Product Schema and Validation Matter

Product Schema: Defines how product data is structured in the database. It ensures consistency and makes it easier to manage the data.

Validation: Protects your application by ensuring only valid data is stored in the database. This helps prevent errors and maintains data integrity.

Features

Create a product with fields like name, description, price, and image URL.

Validate input data to ensure required fields are filled with the correct data types.

Save the validated product data to MongoDB.
