Overview
This milesotone implements a secure login system where users can authenticate using their email/username and password. The system follows best security practices to protect user data by encrypting passwords before storing them and securely verifying login credentials.

Why Secure Authentication is Important

Protect User Data

If the database is compromised, passwords remain secure and unreadable.

Storing hashed passwords prevents attackers from accessing real credentials.

Privacy & Security

Plain text passwords are never stored. Even developers cannot view user passwords.

Ensures confidentiality and prevents unauthorized access.

Compliance with Security Standards

Meets GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance.

Secure authentication is a best practice for handling user credentials.

Prevents Password Theft

Hashed passwords cannot be easily deciphered or cracked.

Prevents attacks like brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.
