Product Management System

This project focuses on building a simple product management feature using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 

Youâ€™ll create a Product Schema, set up an API endpoint to save product data, and learn how to ensure data integrity through validation.

Why Product Schema and Validation Matter

Product Schema: Defines how product data is structured in the database. It ensures consistency and makes it easier to manage the data.

Validation: Protects your application by ensuring only valid data is stored in the database. This helps prevent errors and maintains data integrity.

Features

Create a product with fields like name, description, price, and image URL.

Validate input data to ensure required fields are filled with the correct data types.

Save the validated product data to MongoDB.

Experiment with additional features like admin access and shop profiles for enhanced functionality.
