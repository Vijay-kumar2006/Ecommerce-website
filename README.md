For Milestone  13


 Steps for Milestone 13:

Create an Endpoint for Updating Data


Write a PUT endpoint in the backend to update existing data in MongoDB.

This endpoint will receive the updated data from the frontend and modify the corresponding document in the database.

Frontend: Add an Edit Button

Each product card will have an Edit button.

When the Edit button is clicked:

Fetch the existing data from the database using the product ID.

Populate the form fields with the fetched data to allow users to edit it.

Save and Update the Data

After editing, allow users to submit the form.

Send the updated data to the PUT endpoint to update it in MongoDB.
