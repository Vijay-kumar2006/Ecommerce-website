In this milestone, weâ€™ll build an API endpoint to fetch all product data from the database and display it dynamically on the frontend using a reusable product card component.

Why This Milestone is Important

Learn to Send and Receive Data: Understand how to connect the frontend and backend to retrieve data.

Dynamic Rendering: Display data dynamically by passing it to components, improving scalability and efficiency.


Reusable Components: Use a single component to display multiple products without writing repetitive code.

How it works :

Backend: The GET endpoint fetches all products from the MongoDB database.

Frontend: The fetchProducts function calls the API to get the product data.
