Steps we did for Milestone 8

Step 1: Create the Card Component

Design a self-contained component that displays product details dynamically.

Include key elements such as product name, price, image, and a call-to-action button (e.g., "Add to Cart").

Use props to pass product data dynamically.

Step 2: Design the Homepage Layout

Place multiple product cards within a grid or flex-based layout.

Use mapping functions to generate product cards dynamically based on available product data.

Ensure responsiveness so the layout adjusts on different screen sizes.
